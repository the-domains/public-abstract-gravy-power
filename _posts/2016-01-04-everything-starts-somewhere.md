This is something that I have been wanting to do for a long time but never had the motivation to get off my ass and just do it. I will be trying to post both videos and text on a range of topics to no set schedule. 

Since this is my first post I should introduce myself. My name is Aaron Job and I am a Software Craftsman, I am by far not a Master but with every line of code I write I try to become better. For the last 10 years I have been in the Microsoft space so most of my content will be in C\# but I do plan to adventure off in other languages from time to time.
