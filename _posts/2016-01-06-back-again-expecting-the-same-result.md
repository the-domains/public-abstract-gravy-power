I went back to [Sim'r][0] today and I was very underwhelmed. First there was a $0.50 charge for using my Credit card.

> I don't understand why there is a minimum spend to use card facilities, it is my understanding that vendors are charged a percentage so it costs them the same no matter how much I spend.

Next I had to wait 15 minutes, and finally the coffee was frankly no good. Milk was too hot, coffee was burnt and very weak it had a watery taste to it.

Sorry Sim'r you are now only rated 0.5 Pan Galactic Gargle Blasters.
