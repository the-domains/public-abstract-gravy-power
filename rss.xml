            <title><![CDATA[The Developer ]]></title>
            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>The Developer </h1><p>I tweeted an image a while back and thought I would share it here as well. This is classic and would make for great motivation, but there is a good point behind it.  In my limited experience it has been hard to get across the point of why I write things test first. Often I come back to code just to find that the tests are failing. This makes me sad and fell a bit defeated as I took the time and the care to create something that was testable. I don’t blame the developers who forget about the tests but a lack of professionalism in the software development field. For me this goes back to my training, I was simply not taught about TDD and had to discover and learn about it on my own. I believe that the responsibility of creating better code falls to three parties. </p><img src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/the-grid-img/p/8ca198b56f528f0dc980a8da11cf80afae275587.jpg"></article>]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>Everything starts somewhere</h1><p>This is something that I have been wanting to do for a long time but never had the motivation to get off my ass and just do it. I will be trying to post both videos and text on a range of topics to no set schedule. </p><img src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/the-grid-img/p/fc08a8baf011d96b7af9cb9b2ae7ccb62cba7c1d.jpg"></article>]]></description>
