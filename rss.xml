            <title><![CDATA[Drupal and Pantheon Local Workflow.]]></title>
            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>Drupal and Pantheon Local Workflow.</h1><p>When I first started development with Drupal I spent a long time working out how to set up sites using Aegir. This worked well for me as my first site  was also hosted in production using Aegir, but on my second I ended up hosting with Pantheon, and bended my workflow in ways that started to hurt. Now with that second project live, I took a step back and looked at my workflow and identified the pain points. </p><img src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/the-grid-img/p/7aa9535085ddfbb8878f4b10cc11df7d46470c61.jpg"></article>]]></description>

            <title><![CDATA[The Developer ]]></title>
            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>The Developer </h1><p>I tweeted an image a while back and thought I would share it here as well. This is classic and would make for great motivation, but there is a good point behind it.  In my limited experience it has been hard to get across the point of why I write things test first. Often I come back to code just to find that the tests are failing. This makes me sad and fell a bit defeated as I took the time and the care to create something that was testable. I don’t blame the developers who forget about the tests but a lack of professionalism in the software development field. For me this goes back to my training, I was simply not taught about TDD and had to discover and learn about it on my own. I believe that the responsibility of creating better code falls to three parties. </p><img src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/the-grid-img/p/87fe827f10b01fe62e039feb5585784d4e760773.jpg"></article>]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>Everything starts somewhere</h1><p>This is something that I have been wanting to do for a long time but never had the motivation to get off my ass and just do it. I will be trying to post both videos and text on a range of topics to no set schedule. </p><img src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/the-grid-img/p/fc08a8baf011d96b7af9cb9b2ae7ccb62cba7c1d.jpg"></article>]]></description>
